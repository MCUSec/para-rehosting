# para-rehosting
Finding bugs in microcontroller (MCU) firmware is challenging, even for device manufacturers who own the source code. The MCU runs different instruction sets than x86 and  exposes a very different development environment. This invalidates many existing sophisticated software testing tools on x86. To maintain a unified developing and testing environment, a straightforward way is to re-compile the source code into the native executable for a commodity machine (called rehosting). However, ad-hoc re-hosting is a daunting and tedious task and subject to many issues (library-dependence, kernel-dependence and hardware-dependence). In this work, we systematically explore the portability problem of MCU software and propose para-rehosting to ease the porting process. Specifically, we abstract and implement a portable MCU (PMCU) using the POSIX interface. It models common functions of the MCU cores. For peripheral specific logic, we propose HAL-based peripheral function replacement, in which high-level hardware functions are replaced with an equivalent backend driver on the host. These backend drivers are invoked by well-designed para-APIs and can be reused across many MCU OSs.  We categorize common HAL functions into four types and implement templates  for quick backend development. Using the proposed approach, we have successfully rehosted nine MCU OSs including the widely deployed Amazon FreeRTOS, ARM Mbed OS, Zephyr and LiteOS. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of security testing, we used off-the-shelf dynamic analysis tools (AFL and ASAN) against the rehosted programs and discovered 28 previously-unknown bugs, among which 5 were confirmed by CVE and the other 19 were confirmed by vendors at the time of writing.

## How to setup
To fuzz with provided demos, please prepare the enviroment below.
- Install a new Ubuntu 18.04
```bash
sudo apt update
```
- Install 32bit enviroment
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
``` 
- AFL with LLVM mode
	- Higher than LLVM 11
	- Please refer to https://github.com/google/AFL and https://apt.llvm.org/
```bash
## LLVM ENV
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod +x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 12
# You need more steps to config llvm enviroment
# For example:
# 	# add following to ~/.bashrc and execute command 'source ~/.bashrc'
#		# export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/lib/llvm-12/bin/llvm-config
#		# export PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-12/bin:$PATH

## AFL
git clone https://github.com/google/AFL.git
cd AFL
make
make -C llvm_mode
sudo make install
```

- Pcap
```bash
sudo apt install libpcap0.8-dev:i386 libpcap0.8:i386
```

## How to fuzz
For FreeRTOS, each demo contains a makefile and you only need to run the command `make` to build them.

For Mbed OS, all demos are included in the file main.cpp, and an option `FUZZ_TARGET` is provided to choose which demo is the fuzzing target.

To start fuzzer, please use the command `afl-fuzz -m none -t 1000 -i ./in_dir -o ./our_dir ./binary_file`


> *P.S.*
> 1. *FreeRTOS_FATFS is patched and won't crash. If not, we couldn't reach deeper paths.*
> 2. *Only partial demos are uploaded. Others will come soon.*

## How to port
To port a new RTOS, you need to implement a frondend source file and a header file with the help of RTOS backend. 
Specifically, you have to implement two frontend functions for the RTOS backend.
- PMCU_FE_Yield(): The RTOS operations to switch the tasks with RTOS API.
- FE_Thread_Exit(): The RTOS operations when a task exit.
